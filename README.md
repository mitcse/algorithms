# Algorithms

An open source initiative for implementing and testing algorithms in various programming languages.


## Contributing

The idea here is to learn algorithms by implementing, testing and analyzing them in a bunch of programming languages. I've attempted to do this for a few algorithms in C programming language (*cough*) with the help of a bunch of contributors while pursuing my UG degree.

As part of the [24 pull requests](https://24pullrequests.com) initiative, all contributions are welcome. Some examples may include:

- Implementing an algorithm in a programming language of your choice.
- Adding documentation (introduction, details, etc.) to an algorithm.
- Adding tests and sample input [generators](https://github.com/mitcse/algorithms/tree/master/gcd/generators) to an algorithm.
- Adding performance analysis [charts](https://github.com/mitcse/algorithms/tree/master/brute-force/bubble-sort) to an algorithm.
- Fixing bugs in existing implementations.
- Refactoring ancient ugly-looking code.

#### Who might contribute to this

- Students learning algorithms
- Professionals looking to brush up their skills
- Researchers
- Robots 

#### What will I get out of contributing?

- Open source contributor badge
- A nice looking GitHub profile
- Knowledge and practice
- Top student contributor between Dec 01 and Dec 24 will receive 24 [MATIC](https://polygon.technology) tokens.
